  circle radius (for all circles), horisontal and vertical inter text space
  for highlighted node circle field is a single scale value

Two sets of invisible nodes are required to align floating nodes to appropriate level
The deepest level of the invisible nodes chains are used to avoid linked to root visible nodes

Added feature to use data file in URL (FMTree/index.html?data=path-data-file-extension)
Both CSV and JSON file types are allowed but should be on the same server where FMTree is

d3.hierarchy is used to calculate hierarchy depth only
Nodes by type and total number of nodes are calculated from real data
Short date format (like "yyyy-mm-" and "yyyy-") support is added
The circles for nodes without immages are decreased to half of the other nodes once

Vertically all levels of the chart are aligned to fit size of the level with maximal number of nodes
Horizonrally the inter-level space is calculated to fit the longest texts
Added menu item to fit chart fully in viewing (dashed) area, while refresh will scale chart to 100%

Export to SVG file is added to avoid 16k pixels limitation for raster grafics export and usage
