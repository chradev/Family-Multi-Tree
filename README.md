# Family Multi-Tree (FM Tree)
FM Tree is a simple but powerful web application for viewing, exploring and exporting as high-resolution graphics of Family Multi-Trees described in data files with JSON and CSV (may not currently work) formats.

It is based on the latest Internet technologies, like HTML 5 and the Data-Driven Documents (D3) JavaScript library. In addition, live worldwide maps and timelines are used to make the presentation feature rich and more useful. Currently, the application works well with Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsers on a desktop computer with a high-resolution display capable of showing volume graphics generated for complex multi-trees. For helping the users in preparation and later on maintenance of the data, a simple web application was written in HTML, CSS and pure JavaScript for editing of JSON and CSV data files.

A special care is taken into account about the privacy of the personal data. They can be stored locally or on secured Internet places. For the most paranoid users all the work can be done completely off-line. On the other hand all source data can be kept only in Excel file and only filtered data can be converted to JSON and CSV files for usage with FM Tree application.

There is a debug mode (root.hide: "no") where hidden links are visible for verification of relationships:

The current version (2.6) include bigger data and multi-tree view control like: data privacy, horizontal/vertical views, justified/stacked the same level nodes and their layout positioning. The following image shows snapshot of FMTree application with vertical multi-tree and stacked the same level nodes:
