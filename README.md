# Family Multi-Tree (FMTree)
FMTree is a simple but powerful web application for viewing, exploring and exporting as graphics of Family Multi-Trees described in data files.

It is based on latest Internet technologies like HTML 5 and Data-Driven Documents (D3) Javascript library. In addition live worldwide maps and timeline are used to make presentation feature rich and more useful. Currently application works well with Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox browsers on a desktop computer with height resolution display capable to show volume graphics generated for complex multi-trees.

A special care is taken into account about the privacy of the personal data. They can be stored locally or on secured Internet places. For the most paranoid users all the work can be done completely off-line. On the other hand all source data can be kept only in Excel file and only filtered data can be converted to CSV and JSON files for usage with FMTree application.

There is a debug mode (root.hide: "no") where hidden links are visible for verification of relationships:

The current version (2.5) include bigger data and multi-tree view control like: data privacy, horizontal/vertical views, justified/stacked the same level nodes and their layout positioning. The following image shows snapshot of FMTree application with vertical multi-tree and stacked the same level nodes:
